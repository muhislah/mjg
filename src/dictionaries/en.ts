The term \"agarwood\" generally refers to the dark, fragrant wood produced by the tree in response to infection. This infection triggers a natural defense mechanism, causing the tree to produce resin to protect itself.",

Its scent is often described as deep, woody, and resinous, with hints of sweetness, earthiness, and slight spiciness. Oud has a unique ability to evolve on the skin, making it a highly sought-after ingredient in luxury perfumes.",
